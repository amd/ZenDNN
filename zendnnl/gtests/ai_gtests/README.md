# This test suite has been generated by GHC
# ZenDNNL AI GTests

This folder contains comprehensive Google Test (GTest) suites for validating the ZenDNNL matmul operator and related functionality. The tests are designed to maximize code coverage, robustness, and numerical stability across all supported data types and post-operations, with a special focus on BF16 edge cases and invalid scenarios.

## Test Categories
- **Accuracy Tests**: Validate matmul output against reference implementations for supported data types (e.g., FP32).
- **Boundary Tests**: Stress-test numerical stability for small and large matrix dimensions, including SIMD alignment and cache line boundaries.
- **Edge Case Tests**: Cover minimal and irregular tensor shapes, including 1x1x1 and non-power-of-2 dimensions.
- **Invalid Tests**: Exercise all error and fallback branches in matmul operator/context, including unsupported post-ops, dimension mismatches, and unimplemented kernels.
- **Performance Tests**: Measure kernel execution time and throughput for representative AI workloads.

## Key Files
## Key Files
* `test_matmul_ai.cpp`: Main test logic and test routing
* `gtest_utils_ai.cpp` / `gtest_utils_ai.hpp`: Parameter generation, tensor creation, post-op configuration, and test utilities

## How to Run
1. Build the test suite using CMake and your preferred compiler.
2. Run the tests with your test runner (e.g., `ctest`, `gtest` binary).
3. Review output logs and coverage reports for validation and debugging.

## Coverage Goals
- All matmul operator/context/kernel code paths exercised
- All supported data types and post-ops covered
- Robust negative/invalid case testing
